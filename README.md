# WARNING THESE ARE DANGEROUS TO USE

* ecs-nategateway-bug
  
  This folder has code that almost cost me over 600usd... 
  The project was ment to be used as learnings of how to deploy a docker image to ecs using fargate and be able to easily deploy.

  Looking for help to idenify the bug and how to prevent it in the future.
